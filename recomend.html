            Incisive and highly autonomous, Ivan is one of the most potent developers I know.
            He swiftly gets to the core of a problem, makes sensible, pragmatic technical choices, then produces -
            and as requirements evolve, rapidly iterates upon - clean, succinct solutions. While he has no
            difficulty in adopting new technologies when they are the right tool for the job, he defaults to
            simplicity in his designs. If something needs to be done well, and quickly, then ask Ivan to do it.

            I worked with Ivan and was his direct manager for a couple of years in Nordea Denmark. Ivan is a "10x developer". When I landed at Nordea I realized I needed a "break through" swat team to really move the needle and modernize core of our systems as well as seed the right engineering culture. Ivan was the core and founding member of such team. Capable, fast learning, bright and dedicated effective both at dealing with legacy systems as well as working on a cutting edge projects, with his help we went from an old PL/SQL core to an in-memory compute engine and from an old Oracle based warehouse with rigid and hard to evolve structure to a flexible document-based horizontally scalable data service with streaming API on top. Ivan sets and maintains a very high engineering standards bar but was capable of doing a well calculated compromises not imp[acting fundamental quality when we really needed to ship.
            Don't be misled by Ivan's direct communication style, it comes handy when you will need to get lots of work done and in no way it hinders Ivan's team player capabilities (he is a good team player and a capable tech lead)

            Ivan is an excellent developer and driver of technical solutions to very complex problems. His communication is efficient and he is able to quickly identify challenges, evaluate alternatives and solutions in an open discussion across varying user groups.
            I have witnessed Ivan continually develop his technical skills increasing his delivery capabilities and skillset.
            He is pragmatic and result orientated thus easily able to balance delivery timelines with changing requirements, priorities and infrastructure dependency issues outside his scope.        </q>
