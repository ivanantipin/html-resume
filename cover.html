                In my opinion I am good fit for this position because I always had interest in solving complex solutions
                and have following skills

                - Even though that good programmer shall be agnostic to language it uses, I had experience with scala
                many year ago in project that lasted > 1.5 year, and back then I inspired towards more functional style
                of programming rather OOP
                - I have deep knowledge about JVM internals and performance tunings.
                - I designed number of distributed application with consistency in mind.
                - I have solid CS knoledge a
                - I have heavily used multithreading through my career
                - I always managed to exceed expectations about project delivery.


                I will list number of recomendations of my ex-collegues and can provide more if needed:

                Thank you for your time and consideration.
                I look forward to hearing back from you.

                Incisive and highly autonomous, Ivan is one of the most potent developers I know.
                He swiftly gets to the core of a problem, makes sensible, pragmatic technical choices, then produces -
                and as requirements evolve, rapidly iterates upon - clean, succinct solutions. While he has no
                difficulty in adopting new technologies when they are the right tool for the job, he defaults to
                simplicity in his designs. If something needs to be done well, and quickly, then ask Ivan to do it.
